# Pakistani Sign Language Translator

The **Pakistani Sign Language Translator** is an AI-powered project designed to bridge the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing population. It enables real-time recognition and translation of Pakistani Sign Language (PSL) into text, making communication more inclusive and accessible.

## Key Features

* **Sign Language Detection** – Uses deep learning to process video input and detect PSL gestures.
* **AI Model Integration** – Trained on a custom dataset of PSL gestures to ensure accuracy.
* **Cross-Platform Application** – Built with **Flutter (frontend)** and **Django REST Framework (backend)** for smooth interaction between mobile clients and the AI server.
* **Real-time Translation** – Converts recognized signs into text output to facilitate seamless communication.
* **Dataset Preprocessing** – Includes preprocessing scripts to handle pose estimation and keypoint extraction for model training.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter, GetX
* **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Others:** Git, GitHub, REST APIs

## Credits

This project builds upon the work of the PakSign Team:

**Neelma Naz**
**Maheen Salman**
**Fiza Ayub**
**Zawata Afnan Asif**
